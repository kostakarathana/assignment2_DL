        "Broadcasting is NumPy's mechanism for performing element-wise operations between arrays that don't share identical shapes. Rather than forcing you to manually reshape arrays or write explicit loops, NumPy \"stretches\" the smaller arrays to match the larger ones during computation, but in a memory-efficient and temporary manner (behind the scenes NumPy magic).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Breaking It Down\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy evaluates compatibility by evaluating array shapes from right to left, starting with the trailing dimensions. This rightward-first approach is similar to how we naturally think about nested structures, where the innermost elements are processed first.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if we look at the at the case\n",
        "```python\n",
        "Array A: (3, 1, 4)\n",
        "Array B:    (2, 4)\n",
        "```\n",
        "We can break this down from the eyes of NumPy as\n",
        "```python\n",
        "A: 3 × 1 × 4\n",
        "B:     2 × 4\n",
        "```\n",
        "Now, putting yourself in the shoes in the eyes of a NumPy computer, working from right to left, dimension 4 matches dimension 4 perfectly. Dimension 1 can stretch to match dimension 2 (this is important that the dimension is one). The leftmost dimension 3 has no counterpart in B, so B conceptually gains a dimension of size 1 that can stretch to 3.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Rules of Stretching!**\n",
        "\n",
        "A dimension can be broadcast when either array has size 1 in that position, because a single value can be logically repeated to fill any length. When one array lacks a dimension entirely, NumPy treats it as having size 1 in that position, making it eligible for stretching.\n",
        "\n",
        "Broadcasting might seem amazing and the catch all to all of our ails, but the rules are pretty specific. For example, many people will finish reading this section (if you even did), and think that the array `(3, 4)` can be broadcast with the array `(2, 4)`. However, the `(3, 4)` array cannot broadcast with a `(2, 4)` array because neither the 3 nor the 2 is equal to 1, making them incompatible for stretching."
